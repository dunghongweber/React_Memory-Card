# Problems:

Display all cards in a grid layout with nice UI and animation for user to interact.
Users select 2 cards, then I have to compare if those selections are matched.

# What I learned:

Using Grid in CSS and other transition, transform animation to create better UI.
Apply REACT useEffect with states change to do comparison.
Apply useState to manage users' choices and handle other logic of the game.

# Reflex:

This project helps me practice and strengthen my skill with useState and useEffect.
I also learn a lot of way to use logic, if/else, comparison in react/javascript.
It introduced me to the basic of CSS animation.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
